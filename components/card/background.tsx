        As a recent BSc graduate in Electrical and Electronics Communication
        Technology, I have become a self-taught full-stack web developer.
        Through personal projects, I have gained hands-on experience with a
        diverse tech stack, including React, Vue, Node.js, and Hasura. I am
        eager to apply my skills and knowledge in a web development role.
